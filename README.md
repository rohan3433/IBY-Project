## Technology Stack

### Front-End
- **React.js**: Modular component-based architecture for building the user interface.
- **Chakra UI**: Customizable component library for responsive and accessible UI design.
- **Socket.io-client**: Real-time WebSocket communication between client and server.

### Back-End
- **Node.js**: Scalable server-side JavaScript runtime.
- **Express.js**: Fast and lightweight web framework for handling API requests and routing.
- **Socket.io**: Real-time, bidirectional event-based communication between server and clients.
- **Mongoose**: Elegant MongoDB object modeling for Node.js.

### Database
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for handling persistent data storage, including user profiles and chat history.

### Security
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Secure token-based authentication for user sessions.
- **Bcrypt.js**: Password hashing for secure credential storage.


## Installation

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v14 or higher)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (Local or Atlas cloud instance)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rohan3433/IBY-Project.git

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install

3. **Environment Setup Create a .env file in the root directory with the following configuration:**
   ```bash
   MONGO_URI=your_mongo_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret

4. **Start the Server**
   ```bash
   npm start

5. **Access the Application Open your browser and go to:**
   ```bash
   http://localhost:3000

## Database Setup
The app uses MongoDB as the database. If youâ€™re using MongoDB Atlas, make sure to include the proper connection string in the `MONGO_URI` environment variable. Locally, MongoDB should be installed and running on your machine.

## API Documentation
The backend provides several RESTful API endpoints for user authentication and message handling:

### Authentication
- **POST /api/auth/register**  
  Registers a new user with email and password.

- **POST /api/auth/login**  
  Authenticates a user and returns a JWT for session management.

### Messaging
- **GET /api/messages**  
  Retrieves the chat history for authenticated users.

- **POST /api/messages**  
  Sends a new message to the chat room.

### WebSocket Events
- **Message Event**  
  Sends and receives real-time messages between users.

## Security
**Vibe Talk** prioritizes security with the following measures:

- **Password Hashing**: All passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt before storage.
- **JWT Authentication**: User sessions are managed using signed JWT tokens to ensure secure and stateless authentication.
- **HTTPS**: (Recommended) Ensure secure HTTP communication by deploying the app with SSL/TLS certificates in production.

## Future Improvements
**Vibe Talk** aims to continually evolve with exciting new features. Some planned improvements include:

1. **Dynamic Chat Backgrounds**: Chat background colors will change based on the tone or "vibe" of the conversation, providing a more immersive and interactive experience. This aligns with the app's name, **Vibe Talk**, where the visual style enhances the emotional tone of the conversation.
2. **End-to-End Encryption**: Enhance user privacy and data security by implementing full end-to-end encryption for messages.
3. **Multimedia Messaging**: Add support for sharing images, videos, and voice messages during chats.
